                    <h3>BCA</h3>
                    <p>My experience in BCA has helped me develop a strong foundation in programming, web technologies,
                        and computer concepts. Through coursework, practical labs, and assignments, I learned how to
                        write code, build interfaces, work with databases, and understand how software and systems
                        operate. This experience has improved my analytical thinking, problem-solving ability, and
                        confidence in working with real technical tasks.</p>

                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>My high school experience played an important role in shaping my academic mindset and personal
                        growth. During this period, I developed strong study habits, communication skills, and
                        confidence. I participated in learning activities that strengthened my reasoning ability,
                        creativity, and understanding of core subjects. This stage helped build the foundation that
                        later supported my journey into higher education and technology.</p>

                    <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                    <p>My Intermediate experience played a key role in shaping my academic development and future goals.
                        During this phase, I improved my study skills, analytical thinking, and subject understanding
                        while becoming more disciplined and focused. It was also the time where I started taking more
                        interest in technology and digital learning, which guided me toward choosing a computer-related
                        field for higher studies.</p>
